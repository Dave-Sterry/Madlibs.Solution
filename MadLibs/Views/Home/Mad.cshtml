    <p>Today, every person has a computer small enough to fit into their @Model.Noun. They can solve any math problem by
        simply pushing the computer's little @Model.PluralNoun. Computers can add, multiply, divide and @Model.Verb.
        They can also @Model.VerbTwo better than a human. Some computers are @Model.Adjective. Others have a/an
        @Model.AdjectiveTwo screen that shows all kinds of @Model.PluralNounTwo and @Model.AdjectiveThree figures.</p>
